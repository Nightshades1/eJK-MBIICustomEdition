# Upgraded Windows Libs
EternalJK was somehow a bit outdated but it's okay, i took some minutes to update Libpng,Libjpeg,Zlib,SDL2, jesus linux is easier for that u_u.

# Note
All EternalJK new Cvars aren't listed here, only my new addition are documented<br>You might need to get used to that engine.

## How it work ?
It manipulate the Configuration sent from the server and finally rebuild the state of the game.

It may have delay in updating, if you wish to not wait a new round then go to the menu and toggle force model on/off.

That should refresh the game state without the need of waiting.

**It doesn't touch anything in cgame,ui dll's it's completely legit and doesn't touch anything related to MBII Code !**

# Installation
Simply Extract in your GameData folder and replace, if the launcher ask for updated files it may delete it and download their "own version of the engine".

In MBII Launcher select "Settings" -> "Engine" -> then choose "MBII Client" finally hit the play button, have fun <3
