# Using Rend2
Start your game and open your console, finally enter:<br>
/cl_renderer rd-rend2;vid_restart<br><br>
If you wish to use the default renderer again then enter:<br>
/cl_renderer rd-vanilla-mbii;vid_restart<br>

It is experimental and may have graphical bug/crash on certain map(s), in case you are dueling um_dojo is a recommanded map with no bug(s), you can easly reach 300fps with the graphics at the maximum, glows/shadows included, finally the game using our GPU as intended.<br><br>
Note: Some rendering cvar(s) from EJK are missing into Rend2 as i haven't added them (smart picmip) and others, anyway you don't need any of that, with that renderer you get insane amount of FPS at maximum graphics in 1080p or more, at some point Rend2 might bring bugfixes to make it work flawlessly on MBII ðŸ¤ž let's hope that it'll happen.

# Upgraded Windows Libs
Libpng,Libjpeg,Zlib,SDL2.

# Note
All EternalJK new Cvars aren't listed here, only my new addition are documented<br>You might need to get used to that engine.

## How it work ?
It manipulate the Configuration sent from the server and finally rebuild the state of the game.

It may have delay in updating, if you wish to not wait a new round then go to the menu and toggle force model on/off.

That should refresh the game state without the need of waiting.

**It doesn't touch anything in cgame,ui dll's it's completely legit and doesn't touch anything related to MBII Code !**

# Installation
Simply Extract in your GameData folder and replace, if the launcher ask for updated files it may delete it and download their "own version of the engine".

In MBII Launcher select "Settings" -> "Engine" -> then choose "MBII Client" finally hit the play button, have fun <3
